# template_with_lib

Work in progress !  

This is the advanced template rust project created by `cargo auto new with_lib` command.  
The helper project will be created in the folder `automation_tasks_rs`.  
It will have more functionality, provided by the cargo_auto_lib that will accumulate functions commonly used when building rust projects.
